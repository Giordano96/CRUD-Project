# 🍽️ CRUD-Project

A **web-app** project to manage available pantry products and suggest recipes that can be cooked with them.  

The system is based on the analysis of a recipes dataset available on Kaggle:  
➡️ [Better Recipes for a Better Life](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/better-recipes-for-a-better-life?resource=download)

---

## 🎯 Goals
- CRUD management of pantry products (create, read, update, delete).  
- Link between available ingredients and possible recipes.  
- Dataset analysis to extract useful insights from recipes.  
- Build a working prototype using Python and web tools.

Apple-Cranberry Crostada,"Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples 1/2 cup sugar and cranberries; cover and cook until apples release their liquid about 5 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook stirring frequently until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency about 5 minutes longer. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.)
Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a rectangle about 10 by 16 inches. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesnt stick and allows easy cleanup.)
Spread cooked apples over pastry leaving a 2-inch border. Fold up pastry borders over apples. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar. Bake until pastry is golden brown 25 to 30 minutes.

Apple Pie by Grandma Ople,"Peel and core apples then thinly slice. Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.
Place sliced apples into the bottom crust forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.
Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so theyre almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.
Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position.
Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary and pinch to secure.
Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice but make sure it doesnt run off the sides.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft 35 to 45 minutes.

Coffee-Dusted Pear Galette,"In a large bowl mix together the flour sugar and salt. Using a box grater grate the cold butter atop the flour mixture. Working quickly and using your hands break the butter bits into the flour until theyre evenly distributed and resemble the size of small peas.
Add 4 tablespoons of water and mix. The mixture will be shaggy at this point. From here add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until the dough comes together (generally about 3 additional tablespoons). Flour a work surface and dump the dough onto it. Knead a few times until it comes together. Form dough into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour ideally overnight.
Just before the dough is ready to remove from the fridge mix together the filling. In a medium bowl toss together the pear slices brown sugar cocoa powder coffee grounds vanilla extract and salt.
Remove the disk of dough from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for 10 minutes. Liberally flour a work surface and rolling pin. Begin to roll the dough to a 16-inch round being sure to rotate it every so often to avoid sticking Using the bottom of a bowl or plate that measures about 6 inches in diameter cut out 3 circles. Re-roll the scraps to get 1 additional circle.
Arrange the pears slices neatly in a circular pattern in the center of each of the pie crust rounds leaving about 1 1/2 inch clear at the edges. Fold over the edges to cover about 1/2 inch of the filling. Repeat with the remaining rounds. Transfer the galettes to a baking sheet lined with Reynolds® Parchment Paper and place in the freezer to chill for 15 minutes. Meanwhile preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.
Lastly brush the pie crust edges with the egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Transfer to the oven to bake for 20 to 25 minutes until the edges are golden brown. Check on the galettes periodically. If at any time the crusts edges are getting too brown take a piece of Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil and tent over the edges. When the edges are golden brown remove from the oven. Serve warm with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of your favorite vanilla ice cream.

Reshteh Polo (Persian Noodle Rice),"Place rice in a medium bowl and cover with tepid water. Gently swish it around with your finger to activate the starches then tip the bowl to drain water. Repeat this process until water runs clear about 7 rinses. Cover rice with cold water add 1/2 tablespoon salt stir gently and soak for 1 hour. Drain rice without rinsing.
Crush saffron threads to a powder in a small mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl with 2 tablespoons boiling water. Stir cover and set saffron water aside.
Fill a 5-quart nonstick pot with 9 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved. Break roasted noodles into thirds and add to the boiling water with the rice. Stir once gently and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over. Taste water for salt and adjust accordingly. Cook until the first rice grain pops up to the surface. Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook scooping off any foam from the surface until the timer goes off. Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside 6 to 8 minutes more.
Drain rice and noodles in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch. Taste and gently rinse again if too salty. Set aside to drain completely. Wash and dry the pot.
Place the clean pot over medium heat. Add oil 1 tablespoon saffron water and a pinch of salt; swirl the pot until the bottom and lower sides are coated with the oil mixture. Tightly overlap potato slices in a single layer covering the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer.
Gently scatter rice-noodle mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape making sure potatoes are completely covered and moving noodles away from the sides of the pot. Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into the rice and noodles a few times being careful not to hit the tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking. Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and tahdig starts to set about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile combine 1/4 cup boiling water with 2 tablespoons melted butter and remaining saffron water. Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface.
Test the tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. When the pot sizzles remove it from the heat. Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot. Wrap the towel around the lid and secure the ends at the top by the handle so they will not hang near the heat source. Drizzle the butter mixture over the rice and cover with the towel-wrapped lid.
Place a heat diffuser on a burner over low or medium-low heat and return the pot to the stove. Cook until crispy rotating the pot a few times about 35 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on a damp kitchen towel; let sit uncovered for 5 minutes so tahdig will release easily.
Meanwhile melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small pan over medium heat. Add dates raisins and cinnamon; sprinkle with a little salt. Cook and stir until dates are glistening and soft 3 to 5 minutes.
Gently scatter rice on a platter and remove potato tahdig pieces and serve on the side.
